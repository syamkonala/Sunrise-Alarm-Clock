A group of my biomedical engineering peers and I wanted to provide a more pleasurable experience while waking up. 
There is much research alluding to the fact that waking up to sunlight is the best for your body's natural processes, so we decided to create an alarm clock/lamp that mimics the sunrise. 
Such items already exist on the market but we wanted to make a more cost-effective version. 
We used a combination of Arduino, SolidWorks, LEDs, a breadboard, and also a 3D printer to make this project come to life.
